**Course Description**: Mathematical equations governing fluid flow in reservoirs; numerical methods to solve the equations; numerical reservoir simulation; treatment of wells; history matching; a simulation project performed using a commercial simulator. Restricted to students admitted to major sequence in geosystems engineering and hydrogeology or petroleum engineering.  


**Prerequisites:** Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering 323L  

**Book:** Most of the reservoir simulation textbooks are out-dated and/or are geared towards graduate students. There are several books that would make a good reference which are included below.
